# Welcome to the Oxidize-the-boring-stuff

Oxidize the boring stuff is my attempt to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) while creating useful apps. The idea was taken from the very popular book called [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

In his book Al ramps up the reader to a proficient level of [Python](https://www.python.org/). He then walks them through creating scripts (programs? yes.) that meet some every day challenges. Ah! Learn a language **and** create something useful. That book covers these subjects:

- Search for text in a file or across multiple files
- Create, update, move, and rename files and folders
- Search the Web and download online content
- Update and format data in Excel spreadsheets of any size
- Split, merge, watermark, and encrypt PDFs
- Send reminder emails and text notifications
- Fill out online forms

That is what I want to do... well kind of. Maybe a few modifications.

First. I less than a noob when it comes to Rust. In fact, I can't even spell Wrust without Google. Second, I *want* to try to complete, in Rust, all the exercises listed from Al's book. However, there maybe a few itches I have that I will tackle.

## Oxidize the boring stuff outline
- Read csv file downloaded from your bank,
  - Checking or Credit Card
  - Format the output, add categories
  - Save to an Excel spreadsheet
  - Advanced: save to database (sqlite?)
- CRUD stuff from database created in the first challenge.
  - Read, query and create reports for spending "habits."
